# AUTOMATE CIS AWS FOUNDATIONS BENCHMARK CONTROLS WITH CLOUDFORMATION

## PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to automate as many of the [CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf) controls as possible using AWS CloudFormation.  

## BACKGROUND
I got the idea to start this project after using the really awesome tool [Prowler: AWS CIS Benchmark Tool](https://github.com/Alfresco/aws-cis-security-benchmark) which automates all of the checks for the CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark. As I started the process of piece mealing my own templates, I found a cloudonaut.io [CloudTrail across all regions](https://cloudonaut.io/security-templates-for-aws-cloudformation/) template that helped get me started on this journey.
